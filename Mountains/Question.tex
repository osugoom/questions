  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Assuming the tallest mountains on Earth approach the maximum height before elastic failure, estimate the elastic limit of rock.
    \item What would the maximum height of a mountain be on Mars?
    \item What is the maximum radius of an asteroid or before it becomes spherical due to its own self-gravity?
  \end{enumerate}
